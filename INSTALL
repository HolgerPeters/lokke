Getting started
===============

In addition to the platform specific notes below, you may want to
peruse the [`dev/prep-*` ](dev/) scripts in the source tree as a guide
to the requirements on for any given platform.  Some are being used to
prep the CI hosts, and those should be completely up-to-date.

Platform specific notes
=======================

Debian (and some derivatives)
-----------------------------

Debian is covered in the [Getting started section of the
README](README#getting-started), and that information may also suffice
for many Debian derivatives like Ubuntu.

FreeBSD
-------

The build requires GNU make (`pkg install gmake`), and so please
substitute `gmake` for `make` in any of our build instructions, e.g.

    gmake check

See [`dev/prep-for-freebsd-build` ](dev/prep-for-freebsd-build) for a
set up process that worked for at least FreeBSD 12.2, and please let
us know if you encounter trouble.
